The project consist of 4 main parts:

0. Data Download
1. Data Loader
2. Predictor
3. Portfolio

The predictor is essentially built using a TCN as an encoder, thereby ensuring some form
of non stasionarity and ideally a Neural SDEs as Infinite-Dimensional GANs as a decoder, such
that we have a non parametric estimation of the diffussion matrix.

Do we make the prediction in portfolios?
(Obtaining a non parametric full estimation for the diffussion matrix)

How good is the predictor?
